## qov: the Quite Ok Video Format
building off of the work of Dominic Szablewski's QOI and QOA image and audio formats, I aim in this project to create a simple,
performant video format for use in environments needing high-speed or low-compute codec performance.

## things to do
- qoi encoder
- qoi decoder
- qoa encoder
- qoa decoder
- video spec
- qov encoder
- qov decoder
